# Wine Classifier
<!-- Image of product/preferably homepage -->
Wine Classifier uses a scikit-learn dataset to create classifier models that identify types of wine. The data is the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy by three different cultivators. There are thirteen different measurements taken for different constituents found in the three types of wine.

<a name="purpose"/>

## Purpose
<!-- Why use this product? -->
I wanted to share what I've learned in the Data Science field by
- Exploring scikit-learn's Wine recognition dataset.
- Creating a Decision Tree Classification model to essentailly showcase how these models are working visually.

- Implementing a Random Forest model and a Support Vector model (SVM) to classify the dataset between three different types of wine.
- Building an Ensemble model to optimize classification between all of the models.
